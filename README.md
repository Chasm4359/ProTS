## Quick Start
To start forecasting, we first need to import some packages.
```python
import datetime as dt
import os
import pandas as pd
import evaluation.metrics as em
import feature.feature_lag_selection as fls
import feature.feature_external_selection as fes
import feature.feature_transformation as ft
import feature.time_categorical as tc
import feature.time_stationarization as ts
import models.model_init as mi
import models.benchmark_init as bi
import postprocessing.quantile as ppq
import postprocessing.value as ppv
from forecast.scenario import calculate_scenario
import random
import torch
import pickle
import argparse
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import ast
```
Import the dataset, the example of the format of the dataset can be seen in [./data](https://github.com/Leo-VK/ProEnFo/tree/main/data/GFC14_load). 
```python
site_id = 'GFC14_load'
file_name = "load_with_weather.pkl"
data = pd.read_pickle(f"data/{site_id}/{file_name}")
target = 'load'
```
Define your forecasting setting, eg, forecasting quantiles, and feature engineering strategy.
```
err_tot, forecast_tot, true = calculate_scenario(data=data,
                                                target=target,
                                                methods_to_train=methods_to_train,
                                                horizon=horizon,
                                                train_ratio=train_ratio,
                                                feature_transformation=feature_transformation,
                                                time_stationarization=time_stationarization,
                                                datetime_features=datetime_features,
                                                target_lag_selection=target_lag_selection,
                                                external_feature_selection=external_feature_selection,
                                                post_processing_quantile=post_processing_quantile,
                                                post_processing_value=post_processing_value,
                                                evaluation_metrics=evaluation_metrics,
                                                device = device,
                                                prob_forecasting = False,
                                                strategy=train_stratehy,
                                                data_name=name
                                                            )
```


## How to use the forecasting error-cost data
```python
from scipy.io import loadmat
breakpoint_new=loadmat('./simulated_data/breakpoint_new.mat')
breakpoint_new.pop("__header__")
breakpoint_new.pop("__version__")
breakpoint_new.pop("__globals__")
breakpoint_raw=list(breakpoint_new.values())
breakpoint = pytorchtools.breakpoint_generator(breakpoint_raw)[8]#take hour 9 as an example
loss_function = pytorchtools.ContinuousPiecewiseLinearFunction(breakpoint)
```

## How to add your own forecasting method into the framework
Based on Pytorch, users can simply add their own defined deep learning network to our forecasting framework.
Firstly, users need to define the initialization method for the model in [./models/model_init.py](https://github.com/Leo-VK/ProEnFo/blob/main/models/model_init.py)
```python
class MYQuantile_Regressor(MultiQuantileRegressor):
    def __init__(self, quantiles: List[float] = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9]):
        super().__init__(
            X_scaler=StandardScaler(),
            y_scaler=StandardScaler(),
            quantiles=quantiles)

    def set_params(self, input_dim: int,external_features_diminsion: int):
        self.model = models.pytorch.PytorchRegressor(
            model=models.pytorch.MYQuantile_Model(input_dim,external_features_diminsion, n_output=len(self.quantiles)),
            loss_function=pytorchtools.PinballLoss(self.quantiles))
        return self
```
Secondly, users need to add the structure of the model in [./models/pytorch.py](https://github.com/Leo-VK/ProEnFo/blob/main/models/pytorch.py)
```python
class MYQuantile_Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self,input_parameters):
        super(MYQuantile_Model, self).__init__()
        '''
        build your model here
        '''
    def forward(self, X_batch,X_batch_ex):
        '''
        input the data into the model, here X_batch is the sequence data while X_batch_ex is the external variable.
        '''
        return output
```
Finally, you can add your model to the methods_to_train.
```python
methods_to_train.append(mi.MYQuantile_Regressor())
```

## Forecasting evaluation
We include several metrics to evaluate the forecasting performance and summarize them below. For details, users can check it in [./evaluation/metrics.py](https://github.com/Leo-VK/ProEnFo/blob/main/evaluation/metrics.py)
|    |       Metrics      | Calculation method | Metric type |                                                                     Description                                                                    |
|:--:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  1 | CoverageError (CE) |          $$CE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} (I(L_t \leq y_t \leq U_t) - (UB - LB))$$         |  probility  |    measures the difference between the proportion of actual observations falling within the forecasting interval and the expected coverage rate    |
|  2 | Winkler Score (WS) |        -        | probability |         evaluates whether the forecasting interval accurately captures actual observations, taking into account the width of the interval.         |
|  3 |  Pinball Loss (PL) |          $$PL=\frac{1}{n_\tau \cdot n} \sum_{t=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^{n_\tau} L_\tau\left(\hat{y}_{\tau,t}, y_t\right)$$         |  probability  |             weights the error based on whether the forecasting value falls on the side of the actual observation value (above or below)            |
|  4 |   RampScore (RS)   |          -         |  probability  |                                     measures the consistency of the slope (i.e. increasing or decreasing trend)                                    |
|  5 |  CalibrationError  |          -         |  probability  |                                      evaluates the accuracy of forecasting models in representing uncertainty                                      |
|  6 |    IntervalWidth   |          -         |  probability  |                                             calculates the width of probabilistic forecasting intervals                                            |
|  7 |  QuantileCrossing  |          -         |  probability  | gives the ratio of any two quantiles in which the predicted value of the lower quantile is greater than the predicted value of the higher quantile |
|  8 |  BoundaryCrossing  |          -         |  probability  |                                 calculates the probability that the true value falls outside the forecasting range                                 |
|  9 |      Skewness      |          -         |  probability  |                                                  describes the shape of a probability distribution                                                 |
| 10 |      Kurtosis      |          -         |  probability  |                                                  describes the shape of a probability distribution                                                 |
| 11 | QuartileDispersion |          -         |  probability  |                                                 measures the statistical dispersion of distribution                                                |
| 12 |        MAPE        |          $$\text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left\| \frac{y_t - F_t}{y_t} \right\| \times 100\%$$         |    point    |                                     calculates the average percentage of forecasting error for all data points                                     |
| 13 |         MAE        |          -         |    point    |                               calculates the average of the absolute value of forecasting errors for all data points                               |
| 14 |        MASE        |          $$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} (y_t - F_t)^2}$$         |    point    |         calculates errors by comparing the forecasting error with the average absolute first-order difference of the actual value sequence         |
| 15 |        RMSE        |          $$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} \left\| y_t - F_t \right\|$$         |    point    |                                calculates the square root of the average of the sum of squares of forecasting errors |

Based on different quantiles, we can give evaluation metrics in matrix form and visualize them to intuitively compare different forecasting methods. The following are relevant visualization examples.
